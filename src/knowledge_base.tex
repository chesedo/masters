\section{Building a knowledge base}
We build an initial context with basic attributes like, has fixed deadline, can adapt to changes, and testing first development.
Next, we add the set of most popular methodologies to this context.
Then we do an attribute exploration to confirm each methodology can be identified uniquely.
This is likely to add new attributes to our context.

Then we do an object exploration to add more methodologies to our context.
The attribute exploration followed by object exploration is done repeatedly until some x...
